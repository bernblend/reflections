1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm collaborating with others on projects or if I'm working on multiple computers.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the files may be incomplete, which may in turn bring about issues at compilation or run time.
